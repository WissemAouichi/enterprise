## Settings

See the [Pie API](./pie) as this is just a pie setting.

## Code Example

This example shows how to invoke a dount bar chart with a dataset controlling the values.

```javascript
  var donutData = [{
    data: [{
        name: 'Component A',
        value: 30,
        attributes: [
          { name: 'id', value: 'comp-a' },
          { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'comp-ac-automation-id' }
        ]
    }, {
        name: 'Component B',
        value: 40,
        attributes: [
          { name: 'id', value: 'comp-a' },
          { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'comp-ac-automation-id' }
        ]
    }],
    centerLabel: 'Donut Chart'
  }];

  $('#pie-donut-example').chart({type: 'donut', dataset: donutData}).on('selected', function (e, elem, args) {
    console.log(e, elem, args);
  });
```

## Accessibility

- The contrast and actual colors can be a concern for visibility impaired and color blind people. However, you can customize the color by passing higher contrast colors.

## Code Tips

You can control the size of the donut chart by setting the size of the parent element the donut lives in.
This may include possibly using an inset margin in some cases.

See also pie chart.

## Testability

You can add custom id's/automation id's to the donut chart that can be used for scripting using the `attributes` data attribute. This data attribute can be either an object or an array for setting multiple values such as an automation-id or other attributes. For example:

Setting the id/automation id with a string value or function. The function will give you the data as a parameter for making things more dynamic.

```js
{
    name: 'Component C',
    value: 14,
    attributes: [
      { name: 'id', value: 'comp-c' },
      { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'comp-c-automation-id' }
    ]
}
```

Providing the data this will add an ID added to the pie slice. In addition the related legend item will get the same id with `-legend` appended after it.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

None

## Upgrading from 3.X

- The donut chart was added in 3.6. From 3.6 the api is mostly compatible.
